# Introduction
Radial Distribution Function (**RDF**) is the probability of finding a pair of atoms a
distance r apart relative to the probability for a completely uniform distribution. It is most commonly used in gasses,
liquids, and solutions, since it can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties such as the internal energy 
and pressure of the system. But is relevant at any size scale, such as packing of colloids, and is useful in complex
heterogeneous media, such as the distribution of ions around DNA. 

The following code shows an example of obtaining RDF for snapshots (128) extracted from a molecular dynamics simulation of water, reported in directory `pbe400_128`. 

The code is composed of four sections:
   - (1) **INTRO**
   - (2) **GET LIST OF FILE NAMES**: The atomic structure from the XYZ file in directory `pbe400_128` are loaded
   - (3) **COMPUTE RDF** :The total average, minimum, and maximum RDF for OO, OH, and HH are collected.
   - (4) **PLOT** : The results are plotted.(A sample plot attached below)

To speed up the calculation, the code is parallelized and the sample plot is obtained by running the code on four cores.
