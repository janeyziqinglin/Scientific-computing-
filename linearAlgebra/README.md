# Introduction
Linear Algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is the building blocks of modern physical science, like quantum mechanics, as it allows efficient simulation of many natural phenomena. Matrices also appears in your everyday life, the numbers you put in an excel spreadsheet could 
be represented as a matrix. Therefore, understanding the definition of matrices, matrix algorithms, as well as 
matrix transformation is benefitial to speeding things up. 

This tutorial provided the fundamentals to compute basics linear algebra calculations using python. 
It is divided into 3 parts:
1. Matrix Representation
2. Matrix Transformation 
3. Eigenvalue and Eigenvector 

For definition of key concepts, please refer to "Differential Equations and Linear Algebra" by Professor Strang ISBN: 9780980232776.
