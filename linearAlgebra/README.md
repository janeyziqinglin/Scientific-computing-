# Introduction
Linear Algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. 
For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern physical science
like quantum mechanics, as it allows efficient simulation of many natural phenomena.

This tutorial provided the fundamentals to compute basics linear algebra calculations using python. 
It is divided into 3 parts:
1. Matrices Representation
2. Matrix manipulation 
3. Eigenvalue and Eigenvector 
4. Real-life example
